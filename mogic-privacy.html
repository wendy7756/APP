  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 28, 2025</p>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Mogic</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information when you use the Mogic mobile application (the “App”). 
    Mogic is an entertainment app that provides a collection of interactive experiences such as quizzes, puzzles, and visual challenges.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not require you to create an account or log in.</li>
    <li>We do not collect your name, email, address, or any personal identifiers.</li>
    <li>We do not collect or store any user-generated content. All interactive content in Mogic is created and managed by our team.</li>
    <li>We do not track precise location or collect GPS data.</li>
    <li>We do not access your contacts, photos, microphone, or camera.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Information We May Collect Automatically</h2>
  <p>
    Mogic may collect a small amount of technical information automatically through standard mobile analytics tools to ensure the app works properly.
    This information is not personally identifiable and is used only to improve app performance.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
    <li>App version and performance metrics (for example, crash logs)</li>
    <li>Anonymous usage data such as number of sessions or time spent in the app</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data may be processed through Apple analytics services that comply with their respective privacy frameworks.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To maintain and improve app stability and performance</li>
    <li>To understand aggregate usage patterns (for example, which experiences are most popular)</li>
    <li>To fix bugs and enhance user experience</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Information Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share any personal information with third parties.  
    We may use trusted analytics or crash-reporting providers (for example, Apple App Analytics) solely to operate and improve the app.  
    These providers cannot use your data for any other purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Anonymous analytics and crash data are retained for a limited time (typically up to 12 months) and then automatically deleted or aggregated.  
    No personally identifiable information is stored on our servers.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Mogic is designed for general audiences and is not directed toward children under 13.  
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.  
    If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>
    Because we do not collect personal data or require registration, there is no personal information to access, modify, or delete.  
    You can stop all data collection by uninstalling the app from your device.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information processed by the app.  
    However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect minor updates or technical changes.  
    The “Effective date” above will indicate the latest revision.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
