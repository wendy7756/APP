      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last updated: September 25, 2025</p>

      <p>Welcome to <strong>Manifestly: Affirm Your Vision</strong>. By downloading or using this app, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (“Terms”) and our <a href="https://wendy7756.github.io/APP/M-Privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the app.</p>

      <h2>Acknowledgement</h2>
      <p>This End User License Agreement (EULA) is concluded between you (the “End-User”) and the developer of Manifestly, not with Apple Inc. The developer, not Apple, is solely responsible for the app, its content, and any related claims or support.</p>

      <h2>Purpose of the App</h2>
      <p>Manifestly is designed as a personal journaling and self-growth tool. It helps you practice gratitude, affirmations, vision boards, and identity cards, inspired by manifestation theory — the idea that focusing on positive thoughts, goals, and self-belief can bring constructive changes in life.</p>

      <h2>Scope of License</h2>
      <p>Manifestly is licensed, not sold, to you. We grant you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to install and use the app on any Apple-branded device that you own or control, in accordance with Apple’s Usage Rules. You may not distribute, resell, reverse-engineer, or modify the app or any part of it.</p>

      <h2>Personal Use Only</h2>
      <p>This app is intended for personal, non-commercial use. You may use it to create, store, and manage your own content. You may not use it for unlawful, harmful, or exploitative purposes.</p>

      <h2>Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Some features of the app are free; others require a paid subscription (“Premium”).</li>
        <li>Payment is processed by Apple through your App Store account.</li>
        <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the billing cycle.</li>
        <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your device settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data & Privacy</h2>
      <p>All content you create in Manifestly is stored locally on your device, and optionally in your own iCloud account if you enable sync. We do not operate any servers to collect or process your data. Please review our <a href="https://wendy7756.github.io/APP/M-Privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

      <h2>Maintenance and Support</h2>

      <h2>Warranty</h2>
      <p>If the app fails to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the purchase price. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the app, and any claims or damages arising from such failure shall be the developer’s responsibility.</p>

      <h2>No Warranty</h2>
      <p>The app and all related services are provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory. We disclaim all warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, and non-infringement. You assume full responsibility for your use of the app.</p>

      <h2>Product Claims</h2>
      <p>The developer, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims by you or third parties relating to the app, including but not limited to product liability, compliance with regulations, and consumer protection or privacy issues.</p>

      <h2>External Services</h2>
      <p>The app may provide access to third-party services such as iCloud or Apple payment systems. Your use of these services is at your sole risk, and we are not responsible for their content, accuracy, or availability.</p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Manifestly and its creator shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use or inability to use the app. In no event shall our total liability exceed fifty U.S. dollars (USD $50.00).</p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the app if you violate these Terms or engage in any activity deemed abusive, unlawful, or harmful. Upon termination, your rights under this license will cease immediately.</p>

      <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
      <p>You agree not to export or re-export the app except as authorized by applicable laws of the United States and your jurisdiction. You confirm that you are not on any U.S. government restricted party list.</p>
