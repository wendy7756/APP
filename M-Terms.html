      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last updated: September 25, 2025</p>

      <p>Welcome to <strong>Manifestly</strong>. By downloading or using this app, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (“Terms”) and our <a href="https://wendy7756.github.io/APP/M-Privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the app.</p>

      <h2>Purpose of the App</h2>
      <p>Manifestly is designed as a personal journaling and self-growth tool. It helps you practice gratitude, affirmations, vision boards, and identity cards, inspired by manifestation theory — the idea that focusing on positive thoughts, goals, and self-belief can bring constructive changes in life.</p>

      <h2>License</h2>
      <p>Manifestly is licensed, not sold, to you. We grant you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to install and use the app on any Apple-branded device that you own or control, in accordance with Apple’s Usage Rules. You may not distribute, resell, reverse-engineer, or modify the app or any part of it.</p>

      <h2>Personal Use Only</h2>
      <p>This app is intended for personal, non-commercial use. You may use it to create, store, and manage your own content. You may not use it for unlawful, harmful, or exploitative purposes.</p>

      <h2>Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Some features of the app are free; others require a paid subscription (“Premium”).</li>
        <li>Payment is processed by Apple through your App Store account.</li>
        <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the billing cycle.</li>
        <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your device settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data & Privacy</h2>
      <p>All content you create in Manifestly is stored locally on your device, and optionally in your own iCloud account if you enable sync. We do not operate any servers to collect or process your data. Please review our <a href="https://wendy7756.github.io/APP/M-Privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>Manifestation practices are personal and subjective. While many users find value in gratitude journaling, affirmations, and vision boards, we cannot guarantee specific life outcomes. The app is a supportive tool, not a substitute for professional advice in medical, psychological, financial, or legal matters.</p>

      <h2>No Warranty</h2>
      <p>The app and all related services are provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory. We disclaim all warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, and non-infringement. You assume full responsibility for your use of the app.</p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Manifestly and its creator shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use or inability to use the app. In no event shall our total liability exceed fifty U.S. dollars (USD $50.00).</p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the app if you violate these Terms or engage in any activity deemed abusive, unlawful, or harmful. Upon termination, your rights under this license will cease immediately.</p>

      <h2>External Services</h2>
      <p>The app may provide access to third-party services such as iCloud or payment providers. Your use of these services is at your sole risk, and we are not responsible for their content, accuracy, or availability.</p>

      <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
      <p>You agree not to export or re-export the app except as authorized by applicable laws of the United States and your jurisdiction. You confirm that you are not on any U.S. government restricted party list.</p>

      <h2>Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms of Use to reflect product improvements or legal requirements. Material changes will be communicated within the app or on our website.</p>

      <h2>Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
